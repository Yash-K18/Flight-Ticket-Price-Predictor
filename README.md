# Flight-Ticket-Price-Predictor
Flight Ticket Price Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of airline tickets based on various factors such as departure and arrival locations, date of travel, time of booking, airline carrier, and more. 
Features:

Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw flight data to prepare it for model training.
Model training: Implement various machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods to build predictive models.
Model evaluation: Assess the performance of trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error or R-squared.
Deployment: Provide a user-friendly interface or API for users to input flight details and obtain predicted ticket prices.
Goal:
The primary goal of the Flight Ticket Price Predictor project is to assist travelers in planning their trips by providing them with accurate estimates of flight ticket prices. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to reduce uncertainty and help users make informed decisions when booking air travel.

Contributions:
Contributions to the Flight Ticket Price Predictor project are welcome from developers, data scientists, and enthusiasts interested in improving the accuracy and usability of the prediction models. Contributors can participate in tasks such as data collection, model development, feature engineering, and testing.
