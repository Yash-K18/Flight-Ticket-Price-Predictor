# Flight-Ticket-Price-Predictor
Flight Ticket Price Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of airline tickets based on various factors such as departure and arrival locations, date of travel, time of booking, airline carrier, and more. 
Features:

### Data Preprocessing
The raw flight data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for model training. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

### Model Training
Various machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods are implemented to build predictive models. These models are trained using the preprocessed flight data to learn patterns and relationships between different features and ticket prices.

### Model Evaluation
The performance of the trained models is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error or R-squared. This step helps in understanding how well the models generalize to unseen data and how accurately they can predict ticket prices.

### Deployment
A user-friendly interface or API is provided for users to input flight details and obtain predicted ticket prices. This allows travelers to conveniently plan their trips and make informed decisions when booking air travel.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Flight Ticket Price Predictor project are welcome! Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or enthusiast, you can contribute to improving the accuracy and usability of the prediction models. You can participate in tasks such as data collection, model development, feature engineering, and testing.
